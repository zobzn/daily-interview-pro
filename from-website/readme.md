Given two sorted linked lists, merge them in order.

```python
def merge(self, list1, list2):
  # Fill this in.

# Definition for a Linked List.
class ListNode(object):
  def __init__(self, x):
    self.val = x
    self.next = None
```

This can be done recursively and iteratively. See if you can get both solutions.
